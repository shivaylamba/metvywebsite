          <h4>##FEATURE YET TO BE ADDED (Posting and Uploading)
          </h4>
          <p id="ptag">  
            We collect personal data from you when you provide, post or upload it to our Services, such as when you fill out a form, respond to a survey, or submit a resume or fill out a job application on our Services. Suppose you opt to import your address book. In that case, we receive your contacts (including contact information, your service provider(s), or app automatically added to your address book when you communicated with addresses or numbers not already in your list).
            If you sync your contacts or calendars with our Services, we will collect your address book and calendar meeting information to keep growing your network by suggesting connections for you and others and providing information about events, e.g., times, places, attendees, and contacts.
            You don't have to post or upload personal data, though it may limit your ability to grow and engage with your network over our Services if you don't.

<p id = "ptag">

  When you use our services, we collect information about which features you've used, how you've used them, and the devices you use to access our services. See below for more details:

</p>
<ul>
<li> 
  <p id = "ptag">
    Usage Information We collect information about your activity on our services, for instance, how you use them (e.g., date and time you logged in, features you've been using, searches, clicks, and pages which have been shown to you, referring web page address) and how you interact with other users.
  </p>
  </li>
<li>
  <p id = "ptag">
    Device information We collect information from and about the device(s) you use to access our services, including:
 </p>
 <p id = "ptag">Hardware and software information such as IP address, device ID and type, device-specific and apps settings and characteristics, app crashes, advertising IDs (such as Google's AAID and Apple's IDFA, both of which are randomly generated numbers that you can reset by going into your device' settings), browser type, version and language, operating system, time zones, identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser (e.g., IMEI/UDID and MAC address).
    
  </p>
</li> 
<li>
  <p id = "ptag">
    Other information with your consent If you permit us, we collect your precise geolocation (latitude and longitude) through various means, depending on the service and device you're using, including GPS, Bluetooth, or Wi-Fi connections. The collection of your geolocation may occur in the background even when you aren't using the services if the permission you gave us expressly permits such collection. If you decline permission for us to collect your geolocation, we will not collect it. Similarly, we may collect your photos and videos (for instance, if you want to publish a photo, video, or streaming on the services).

  </p>
</li> 
</ul>
<h3><b>2. Cookies and Other Similar Data Collection Technologies
</b></h3>  
<p id = "ptag">
  We use and may allow others to use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels) to recognize you and/or your device(s). You may read our Cookie Policy for more information on why we use them (such as authenticating you, remembering your preferences and settings, analyzing site traffic and trends, delivering and measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, allowing you to use social features), and how you can better control their use, through your browser settings and other tools.
Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) have a "Do Not Track" ("DNT") feature that tells a website that a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked. If a website that responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser's user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option, and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many businesses, including Tinder, do not currently respond to DNT signals.

      </li>
      <li>
        <p id = "ptag">You share information with other users when you voluntarily disclose information on the service (including your public profile). Please be careful with your information and ensure that the content you share is stuff that you're comfortable being publically viewable since neither you nor we can control what others do with your information once you share it.

<h3><b>5.Your Rights

</b></h3> 
<p id = "ptag">
  We want you to be in control of your information, so we have provided you with the following tools:
</p>
 <ul>
  <li>
    <p id = "ptag">Access / Update tools in the service. Tools and account settings that help you to access, rectify or delete information that you provided to us, and that's associated with your account directly within the service. If you have any questions on those tools and settings, please contact our customer care team for help here.
      </p> </li>
      <li>
        <p id = "ptag">Device permissions. Mobile platforms have permission systems for specific types of device data and notifications, such as phone book and location services, as well as push notifications. You can change your settings on your device to either consent or oppose collecting the corresponding information or displaying the corresponding notifications. Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality.

          </p> </li>
         
            

   </ul>
   <p id = "ptag">
   We want you to be aware of your privacy rights. Here are a few key points to remember:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>
      <p id = "ptag">Reviewing your information. Applicable privacy laws may give you the right to review the personal information we keep about you (depending on the jurisdiction, this may be called right of access, right of portability, or variations of those terms).
        </p> </li>
        <li>
          <p id = "ptag">Updating your information. If you believe that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or that we are no longer entitled to use it and want to request its rectification, deletion, or object to its processing.

            </p> </li>
   </ul>
   <p id = "ptag">
   For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before answering the above requests.
Keep in mind; we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if the request is unlawful or infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy of another user. If you wish to receive information relating to another user, such as a copy of any messages you received from him or her through our service, the other user will have to contact our Privacy Officer to provide their written consent before the information is released.
Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to the processing of personal information, notably where such requests would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore. For instance, we cannot provide our service if we do not have your date of birth.
</p><ul> 
  <li>
    <p id = "ptag">Uninstall. You can stop all information collection by an app by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device. If you uninstall the app from your mobile device, the unique identifier associated with your device will continue to be stored. If you re-install the application on the same mobile device, we will re-associate this identifier from your previous transactions and activities.
      </p>
      </li>

</ul>

</p>

<h3><b> 6. Children's Privacy

</b></h3> 

<p id = "ptag">


  These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to take the necessary actions.

</p>



<h3><b> 7. INFORMATION STORAGE AND SECURITY


</b></h3> 
<p id = "ptag">
  We have implemented a wide range of measures to ensure the security and confidentiality of your data. These include physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards such as firewalls, data encryption, SSL, and other up-to-date technologies.
  No security measures, however, are 100% complete. Therefore, we do not promise and cannot guarantee, and thus you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will not be collected and used by others. You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for the unauthorized use of your information or any lost, stolen, compromised passwords or any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.
  We cannot guarantee the security of your data while it is being transmitted over the Internet and through servers that are out of our control. We do our best to protect your personal information, but we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to our Website or Services. Therefore, if you make any data transmissions over the Internet, you are doing it at your own risk. Once we receive the data transmission, we do our best to ensure its security and privacy on our systems.
